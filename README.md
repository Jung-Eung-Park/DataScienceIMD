Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that combines information technology (IT), statistics and management study.

Due to the rapid advancement of IT, much more data and new analytic techniques became available.

We need to balance it with sound statistical knowledge and business expertise to create useful insights.

This website was created to share practical information in data science among scholars at IMD. 

The documents will be updated continuously with hands-on examples.
